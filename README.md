# Programming-Course

What seperate this course from others is it will take the normal learning steps and reverse them.
I learned programming from the gui to the backend. I think it's important to give a glimpse into
have the program work from the begining of the course.

## What is programming?
Programming is can be many thing and mostly i think as programming as philosophy, programming
was invented by trying to recreate a realistic reproduction of the real world. In moderm time
programming has mostly been used to win wars and automate labor work, we are now in programming
starting to go back to the root and reproduce real AI and Learning into our programming.
The day will come for everyone where we also will see this virtual reproduction it's even
written into our own history, like in religion where after death every being come into
this "dream world" where the thoughs happens instantly in the reality.
This science and programmers refers to as the sigularity, where the past, present and the future all comes
into the present and where the being can live for eternity. 

Programming is really where you make some words become alive, you take a few words and now you have
a self-driving car, but the question is what are these words, programming is really take a task
and put it into a written executable file.
